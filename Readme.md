## 📸 Process Visualization
To better understand the data flow and results, two images have been added:
- 🖼️ **`uart_03.png`** - Demonstrates the **UART communication** between the Raspberry Pi and FPGA, showing the sent and received feature maps.
- 🖼️ **`CV02.png`** - Displays the **handwritten digit processing** pipeline, where an image is binarized, sent to the FPGA, and the **6×6 feature map** is extracted.

These images highlight the key processing steps and validate the system’s expected behavior. OpenCV can now utilize the extracted feature map for further image processing tasks.
